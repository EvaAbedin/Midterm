A.






what is class?
A.Class is a blueprint for creating objects.

What is object?
A. A java object is a member of a java class, also called an instance.

What is the entry point of an application?
A.Main method is the entry point of an application.

Why main is static?
A.Main method is static so that JVM can invoke it without instantiating the class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A.The object class is the superclass of all classes.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A.Path variable is used to set the path for all java software tools and
classpath variable is used to set the path for java class.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A.Interface support multiple inheritance but abstract doesn't support multiple inheritance.
And interface has only static and final variables but abstract has static, non-static,
and final, non-final variables.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A.No you can't make an object from an Interface and Abstract class.
But you can instantiate an anonymous class that implements/extends the interface or
abstract class without defining a class object.

what is Access Specifier?
A.An access specifier is a defining code element that can determine which elements of a program
are allowed to access a specific variable or other piece of data.


What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A.OOP(Object-oriented programming)is a computer programming model that
organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
They are: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Abstraction: is a process of exposing all the necessary details and hiding the rest.
Encapsulation: is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data.
Inheritance: is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
Polymorphism:  is the ability of an object to take many forms.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A.A java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages.
The java. lang package is always imported by default.


What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A.API(Application Programming Interface) is a software intermediary that
allows two applications to talk to each other.


Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A.Java doesn't support multiple inheritance because every class is a child of Object class.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A.Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name,
if their argument lists are different.
Overloading happens when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A.






What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A.The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly.






What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.

What is final, finally and finalize?
A.

What is a constructor ?
A.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A.

What is JVM stand for ?
A.

Is JVM platform independent?
A.

What version of java are you using?
A.

What is JAR stand for ?
A.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A.

What is compile time and run time?
A.Compile-time is the time at which the source code is converted into an executable code
while the run time is the time at which the executable code is started running.

What is heap?
A. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs.

How java manage it's memory?
A.Java does memory management automatically.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.









What is Singleton class?
A.Singleton is a design pattern that ensures that a class can only have one object.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A.Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory

when to use transient variable in java?
A.The transient modifier can be used where there are data members derived from the other data members within the same instance of the class.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A.While loop check condition before iteration of the loop. On the other hand,
the do-while loop verifies the condition after the execution of the statements inside the loop.

What is Enum?
A.An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants.

What is Iterator?
A.An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A.








Why is String Immutable in Java?
A.The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
A.Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A.A serial collector is a default copying collector
which uses only one GC thread for the GC operation,
while a parallel collector uses multiple GC threads for the GC operation.

What is JIT stands for?
A.Just-In-Time (JIT).

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.The Java heap is the area of memory used to store objects instantiated by applications running on the JVM.
Java Garbage Collection is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A.No, Garbage collection does not guarantee that a program will not run out of memory.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A.Java Heap Space is used throughout the application, but Stack is only used for the method — or methods — currently running.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A.Reflection in Java is the ability to examine and/or modify the properties or behavior of an object at run-time.
It is useful because it allows an executing Java program to examine or "introspect" upon itself,
and manipulate internal properties of the program.

what is multithreading in java?
A. Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program
for maximum utilization of CPU.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A.Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.

What is Framework?
A.Java frameworks are specific to the Java programming language.
 It's a Java platform for developing software applications and Java programs.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
A.They are:
1. Selenium
2. Serenity
3. JUnit
4. TestingNG
5. Cucumber
6. JBehave
7. Mockito

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A.JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java programming language.
TestNG is built over JUnit and NUnit and provides more features for testing an application.

What are the dependencies for this project?
A.A relationships between products or tasks.

what is dependency injection in java?
A.Dependency injection(DI) is the concept in which objects get other required objects from outside.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A.Static binding uses Type information for binding
while Dynamic binding uses Objects to resolve binding.
